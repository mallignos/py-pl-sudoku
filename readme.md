# py-pl-sudoku

Project to see if I could make python and sicstud prolog talk to eachother using JSONRPC.

## How to run.

Run via the command 
```
python3.9 plcom_example.py
python3.9 symbolic_example.py
```
or just run ``make`` with either ``plcom_example`` or ``symbolic_example``

Should work with Windows and Linux now.
